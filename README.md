# The Ray Tracer Challenge

![Build Status](https://github.com/sebas642/the-ray-tracer-challenge-rust/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

A partial implementation of [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge) book using Rust.
This is a side project to learn the Rust programming language.

Debug mode is extremely slow. Sample apps should be executed in release mode which is exponentilly faster.
